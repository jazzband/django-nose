**django-nose** provides all the goodness of `nose`_ in your Django tests, like:

  * Testing just your apps by default, not all the standard ones that happen to
    be in ``INSTALLED_APPS``
  * Running the tests in one or more specific modules (or apps, or classes, or
    folders, or just running a specific test)
  * Obviating the need to import all your tests into ``tests/__init__.py``.
    This not only saves busy-work but also eliminates the possibility of
    accidentally shadowing test classes.
  * Taking advantage of all the useful `nose plugins`_

It also provides:

  * Fixture bundling, an optional feature which speeds up your fixture-based
    tests by a factor of 4
  * Reuse of previously created test DBs, cutting 10 seconds off startup time
  * Hygienic TransactionTestCases, which can save you a DB flush per test
  * Support for various databases. Tested with MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
    Others should work as well.

django-nose requires nose 1.2.1 or later, and the `latest release`_ is
recommended.  It follows the `Django's support policy`_, supporting:

  * Django 1.8 (LTS) with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
  * Django 1.9 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
  * Django 1.10 with Python 2.7, 3.4, or 3.5
