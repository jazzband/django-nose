Features
--------

* All the goodness of `nose`_ in your Django tests
* Fast fixture bundling, an optional feature which speeds up your fixture-based
  tests by a factor of 4
* Reuse of previously created test DBs, saving setup time
* A place to put special Django settings used only during tests

Installation
------------

You can get django-nose from PyPI with... ::

    pip install django-nose

The development version can be installed with... ::

    pip install -e git://github.com/jbalogh/django-nose.git#egg=django-nose

Since django-nose extends Django's built-in test command, you should add it to
your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` in ``settings.py``::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django_nose',
        ...
    )

Then set ``TEST_RUNNER`` in ``settings.py``::

    TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner'


Use
---

The day-to-day use of django-nose is mostly transparent; just run ``./manage.py
test`` as usual. The one new wrinkle is that, whenever your DB schema changes,
you should set the ``FORCE_DB`` environment variable the next time you run
tests. This will cue the test runner to reinitialize the database, which it
usually avoids to save you time::

    FORCE_DB=1 ./manage.py test

Alternatively, if you don't want to be bothered, you can use a slightly slower
but maintenance-free test runner by saying so in ``settings.py``::

    TEST_RUNNER = 'django_nose.BasicNoseRunner'


See ``./manage.py help test`` for all the options nose provides, and look to
the `nose docs`_ for more help with nose.

Enabling Fast Fixtures
----------------------

django-nose includes a nose plugin which drastically speeds up your tests by
eliminating redundant setup of Django test fixtures. To use it...

1. Subclass ``django_nose.FastFixtureTestCase`` instead of
   ``django.test.TestCase``. (I like to import it ``as TestCase`` in my
   project's ``tests/__init__.py`` and then import it from there into my actual
   tests. Then it's easy to sub the base class in an out.)
2. Activate the plugin by passing the ``--with-fixture-bundling`` option to ``./manage.py test``.

How Fixture Bundling Works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The fixture bundler reorders your test classes so that ones with identical sets
of fixtures run adjacently. It then advises the first of each series to load
the fixtures once for all of them (and the remaining ones not to bother). It
also advises the last to tear them down. Depending on the size and repetition
of your fixtures, you can expect a 25% to 50% speed increase.

Incidentally, the author prefers to avoid Django fixtures, as they encourage
irrelevant coupling between tests and make tests harder to comprehend and
modify. For future tests, it is better to use the "model maker" pattern,
creating DB objects programmatically. This way, tests avoid setup they don't
need, and there is a clearer tie between a test and the exact state it
requires. The fixture bundler is intended to make existing tests, which have
already committed to fixtures, more tolerable.

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If using ``--with-fixture-bundling`` causes test failures, it likely indicates
an order dependency between some of your tests. Here are the most frequent
sources of state leakage we have encountered:

* Locale activation, which is maintained in a threadlocal variable. Be sure to
  reset your locale selection between tests.
* memcached contents. Be sure to flush between tests. Many test superclasses do
  this automatically.

It's also possible that you have ``post_save`` signal handlers which create
additional database rows while loading the fixtures. ``FastFixtureTestCase``
isn't yet smart enough to notice this and clean up after it, so you'll have to
go back to plain old ``TestCase`` for now.

Exempting A Class From Bundling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some unusual cases, it is desirable to exempt a test class from fixture
bundling, forcing it to set up and tear down its fixtures at the class
boundaries. For example, we might have a ``TestCase`` subclass which sets up
some state outside the DB in ``setUpClass`` and tears it down in
``tearDownClass``, and it might not be possible to adapt those routines to heed
the advice of the fixture bundler. In such a case, simply set the
``exempt_from_fixture_bundling`` attribute of the test class to ``True``.


settings_test.py
----------------

django-nose allows you to create a ``settings_test`` module where you
can provide configuration settings which are used solely in your
testing environment.

For example, if I wanted to make Celery always eager in my test environment,
I could define ``CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER`` like this:

settings.py::

    CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = False


settings_test.py::

    CELERY_ALWAYS_EAGER = True


Using With South
----------------

`South`_ installs its own test command that turns off migrations during
testing. Make sure that django-nose comes *after* ``south`` in
``INSTALLED_APPS`` so that django_nose's test command is used.

.. _South: http://south.aeracode.org/


Always Passing The Same Options
-------------------------------

To always set the same command line options you can use a `nose.cfg or
setup.cfg`_ (as usual) or you can specify them in settings.py like this::

    NOSE_ARGS = ['--failed', '--stop']

.. _nose.cfg or setup.cfg: http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/0.11.2/usage.html#configuration


Custom Plugins
--------------

If you need to `make custom plugins`_, you can define each plugin class
somewhere within your app and load them from settings.py like this::

    NOSE_PLUGINS = [
        'yourapp.tests.plugins.SystematicDysfunctioner',
        # ...
    ]

Just like middleware or anything else, each string must be a dot-separated,
importable path to an actual class. Each plugin class will be instantiated and
added to the Nose test runner.

Older Versions of Django
------------------------

Upgrading from Django < 1.2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Django 1.2 switches to a `class-based test runner`_. To use django-nose
with Django 1.2, change your ``TEST_RUNNER`` from ``django_nose.run_tests`` to
``django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner``.

``django_nose.run_tests`` will continue to work in Django 1.2, but will raise a
warning. In Django 1.3 it will stop working.

If you were using ``django_nose.run_gis_tests``, you should also switch to
``django_nose.NoseTestSuiteRunner`` and use one of the `spatial backends`_ in
your ``DATABASES`` settings.

.. _class-based test runner: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/releases/1.2/#function-based-test-runners
.. _spatial backends: http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/db-api/#id1

Django 1.1
~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to use django-nose with Django 1.1, use
https://github.com/jbalogh/django-nose/tree/django-1.1 or
http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-nose/0.0.3.
