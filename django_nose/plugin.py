        Test types:

        - Non-database tests (or ones that manage their own database connection

          subclass of ``TransactionTestCase``.
        - ``FastFixtureTestCase`` tests.
        - Subclasses of ``django.test.TestCase`` and other database tests that
          clean up after themselves.
        - ``TransactionTestCase``-based tests, which often leave a mess.

        Django has a weird design decision wherein TransactionTestCase doesn't
        clean up after itself. Instead, it resets the DB to a clean state only
        at the *beginning* of each test:
        https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/?from=olddocs#
        django. test.TransactionTestCase. Thus, Django reorders tests so
        TransactionTestCases all come last. Here we do the same.

        "I think it's historical. We used to have doctests also, adding cleanup
        after each unit test wouldn't necessarily clean up after doctests, so
        you'd have to clean on entry to a test anyway." was once uttered on

            Django's TransactionTestCase doesn't clean up the DB on teardown,
            but it's hard to guess whether subclasses (other than TestCase) do.
            We will assume they don't, unless they have a
            ``cleans_up_after_itself`` attr set to True. This is reasonable
            because the odd behavior of TransactionTestCase is documented, so
            subclasses should by default be assumed to preserve it.

            Thus, things will get these comparands (and run in this order):

            * 0: Not a subclass of TransactionTestCase. These should not hit
                 the DB or, if they do, are responsible for ensuring that it's

                 https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/testing/?from=
                 olddocs#writing-doctests). Note that this could include a
                 group of tests (including TransactionTestCase tests) with
                 setup and/or teardown routines in a "context" such as a
                 module or package defining fixture functions. To avoid that
                 scenario, don't use TestCase or TransactionTestCase in
                 modules or packages with setup or teardown functions.
            * 1: FastFixtureTestCase subclasses. If you're using the
                 FixtureBundlingPlugin, it will pull the FFTCs out, reorder
                 them, and run them before the following groups.
            * 2: TestCase subclasses. These clean up after themselves.
            * 2: TransactionTestCase subclasses with
                 cleans_up_after_itself=True.
