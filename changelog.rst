1.1 (2012-05-19)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Django TransactionTestCases don't clean up after themselves; they leave
  junk in the DB and clean it up only on ``_pre_setup``. Thus, Django makes
  sure these tests run last. Now django-nose does, too. This means one fewer
  source of failures on existing projects. (Erik Rose)
* Add support for hygienic TransactionTestCases. (Erik Rose)
* Support models that are used only for tests. Just put them in any file
  imported in the course of loading tests. No more crazy hacks necessary.
  (Erik Rose)
* Make the fixture bundler more conservative, fixing some conceivable
  situations in which fixtures would not appear as intended if a
  TransactionTestCase found its way into the middle of a bundle. (Erik Rose)
* Fix an error that would surface when using SQLAlchemy with connection
  pooling. (Roger Hu)
* Gracefully ignore the new ``--liveserver`` option introduced in Django 1.4;
  don't let it through to nose. (Adam DePue)

1.0 (2012-03-12)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* New fixture-bundling plugin for avoiding needless fixture setup (Erik Rose)
* Moved FastFixtureTestCase in from test-utils, so now all the
  fixture-bundling stuff is in one library. (Erik Rose)
* Added the REUSE_DB setting for faster startup and shutdown. (Erik Rose)
* Fixed a crash when printing options with certain verbosities. (Daniel Abel)
* Broke hard dependency on MySQL. Support PostgreSQL. (Roger Hu)
* Support SQLite, both memory- and disk-based. (Roger Hu and Erik Rose)
* Nail down versions of the package requirements. (Daniel Mizyrycki)
